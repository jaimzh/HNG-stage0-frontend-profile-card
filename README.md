# 🪄 Profile Card — HNG Frontend Project (Stage 0)

A clean, responsive, and accessible **Profile Card** built with **semantic HTML**, **modern CSS**, and a sprinkle of **vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project was created for **HNG Stage 0** as part of the Frontend Wizards track.  

It includes all required data-testid attributes for automated testing, follows accessibility standards, and updates the current time dynamically using `Date.now()`.
