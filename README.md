# 🪄 Profile Card — HNG Frontend Project (Stage 1)

  

A clean, responsive, and accessible **Profile Card** with multi-page support built using **semantic HTML**, **modern CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  

This project was created for **HNG Stage 1** as part of the Frontend Wizards track.  

  

It now includes **About Me** and **Contact** pages while keeping the **Profile Card** design consistent. All pages are fully accessible, responsive, and maintain proper `data-testid` attributes for automated testing.
